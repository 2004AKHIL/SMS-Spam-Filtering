SMS spam poses significant risks to mobile communication, including privacy breaches and financial fraud. As mobile phones become more ubiquitous, the spread of spam
messages has drawn the interest of attackers, leading to increased incidents of phishing, scams, and fraudulent activity. This raises concerns about user safety and calls
for robust spam filtering techniques.Unlike email spam, which is often blocked by advanced filters, SMS spam can bypass these defenses and reach users' mobile devices
directly. This creates a pathway for spam containing deceptive ads, dangerous links, or phishing attempts designed to steal sensitive information. The challenge is to 
develop effective spam detection methods that can accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.Efforts to combat SMS spam have explored various approaches.
Traditional rule-based systems offer a basic level of filtering but often struggle with adaptability due to the evolving nature of spam techniques. Consequently, machine
learning and natural language processing (NLP) have become the focus of spam detection research. These technologies can analyze patterns in text and learn from data, 
enabling more dynamic and resilient filtering strategies.This work reviews the latest advancements in SMS spam filtering, with a particular emphasis on deep learning and 
NLP algorithms. We discuss the challenges in implementing these technologies, such as dealing with class imbalance (where spam may be much less frequent than legitimate
messages), limited data for training models, and the ever-changing tactics of spammers. The aim is to propose effective solutions to these problems and outline a path for
further research in this domain.Through an analysis of existing literature, real-world examples, and experimental data, this paper seeks to guide future efforts in 
developing robust SMS spam filtering systems. The ultimate goal is to enhance user privacy, improve mobile communication security, and create a safer SMS environment. 
By addressing these issues, we hope to inspire new approaches and encourage innovation in combating SMS spam.
